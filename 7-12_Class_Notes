UML: a pictoral description of object class. for UMLs, you write the name of the object in the top and split the page into two sections.
In the first section, you put the attributes of the object. In the second section, put the functions of the object. 

Example of UML diagrams:
object 1: student
	age:float
	height:float
	weight:float
	taken courses:list
	email:string
	gender:string
	GPA:float

	Think()
	Learn()
	Study()
	Walk()
	Run()
	Drink()
	Sleep()
	Play_Instrument()
	Take_Test()
	
	
object 2: teachers
	email:string
	name:string
	age:float
	IQ:float
	
	Teach()
	Give_Homework()
	Give_Tests()
	Give_Grades

Class:
class Classname:
    def __init__(put parameters here):

    def FuncName():

e.g.
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    def myfunc(self):
        print("Hello my name is" + self.name)
p1 = Person ("John", 36) calling an instance of the class
p1.myfunc() using the instance of the class
e.g.2 (better formatting)
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    def myfunc(self):
        print(f"Hello my name is {self.name}")
p1 = Person ("John", 36) 
p1.myfunc()

any function will stay a linear equation as long as the highest exponent is 1
y = 1x + 1 --> [1  1] (as a matrix)
y = 2x + 2 --> [4  2] (another row is part of the same matrix)
the matrix above is a 2x2 matrix.
y = 3x + 3
y = 4x + 4
y = 5x + 5
y = 6x + 6
y = 7x + 7
y = 8x + 8
y = 9x + 9
y = 10x + 10

if there is only one column in a matrix, it is called a column vector, and if there is only one row, it is called a row vector

matrix multiplication:
multiply rows by columns

images: made of pixels of values 0-255 corresponding with various shades of color (darker the closer it gets to 0).
3D plane: 1 plane of a cube is a channel. 3 channels: Red, blue, and green
all have a light intensity value
