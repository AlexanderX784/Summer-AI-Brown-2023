Recap: OOP- a type of programming which revoles around 'objects', which have 'attributes' and 'functions' that can be drawn as a UML diagram.

libraries can define multiple functions and multiple variables. An example of this is numpy. You are able to import these libraries into your code after installing it in python.
You can call on libraries after installing them. For example, if you improted the math function: 
import math (in order to call the library to your code and allow you to use it)
    from here, you can then use functions from that math function (e.g. math.pow(X,Y)) to find some integer x to the power of y.
    you can also use the square root function in this case, which would be called using math.sqrt(Y)
There are a few ways you can import libraries and their functions into python (libraries are sometimes also called modules):
    1.import (modulename)
    2.import (modulename) as (alternativemodulename)
    2.from (modulename) import (functionname)
    3.from (modulename) import (functionname) as (alternativefunctionname)

You can also import personal libraries. You are able to think of your own python code as libraries.
    examples: if you have a class that you made (for example, the Person class that was made during the 7/12 class, you can import it by typing in import (filename)). The file name should be the file that includes the class inside it.
    you can also install third class libraries from outside using the pip module. To do this, you type pip install (pythonpackagename) or conda install (pythonpackagename) in your terminal.
The most useful libraries are: matplotlib, pytorch, tensorflow, and pandas.

If you installed modules in a conda environment, you must activate that environment first in order to import those modules.
