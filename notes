#Notes
#Creating a list
mylist = [1, 'name', 0.5, 1]
#to remove values:
mylist.remove("name")
#creating a disctionary, which is an ordered collection of data in key:value pair form in curly brackets
mydict = {1: "steve", 2: 5, 3: False}
#getting a value corresponding with a key:
mydict(1)
print(mylist(1))
myset = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(myset)
#Operators
#x == 5, y == 6
#x+y addition
#x/y division
#x-y subtraction
#x**y exponent
#math.floor(x/y) this function gives you the quotient, rounded down (or in other words, the quotient without the remainder)
#x%y this is the mod function, which returns the remainder

#Assignment operators:
#x = 5:
    #x+=5 = 10
    #x-=5 = 0
    #x*=5 = 25
    #x/=5 = 1
    #x%=3 = 2 #this is a mod
    #x//= 4: 1 this is a floor

x = 4
y = 9
#checking if x is equal to y
x == y
#int(False)= 0
#checking if x is greater than y
x > y 
# if you put t = false, t will return false. if you put not t, this will return true.
#is: will be true if both are true. is not: will be true if at least 1 is true
#in: will be true if the specified value is in a specific variable (list, set, etc.). not in: will be true if the specified value is not in a sepcific variable
#for x in range (n) will continue to perform a function for values of x from 0 to n-1
#range(n) returns range (0, n-1). if you want a list, type in list(range(20))
#a while loop will keep running as long as a set condition is true unless there is a "Break" line in between
#while (x<5): print("Hi") x +=1 will give you 5 "hi"s
#a function is a block of code made by writing def (function name)(input parameter):
