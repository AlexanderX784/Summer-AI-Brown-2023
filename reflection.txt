Yesterday I learned about a few different types of AI, like GOFAI, deep learning, machine learning, and Connectionism (I, II, and III). I also learned about perceptrons: 
    Perceptron: y (output) = x (input) * w (weight of decision) in order to make a decision. Does this for all inputs and weights, then adds it all up (summation) - e.g. wi is paired with an xi, multiplied with each other in order to get the importance of the decision. Linear equation
    
Useful commands in git:
    #when adding files use: git add (filename)
    #when commiting files use: git commit 
    #when adding comments/messages: -m "(insert text here)"
    #when git push is used, it uploads everything to the internet.
    #if the file shows a white circle, that means that it was not saved.
    #to clone a repository use: git clone
    #To create a miniconda environment, use conda create (FILENAME) (CODE TYPE E.G. JAVA, PYTHON, ETC)
