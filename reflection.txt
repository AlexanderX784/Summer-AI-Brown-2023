Yesterday I learned about a few different types of AI, like GOFAI, deep learning, machine learning, and Connectionism (I, II, and III)
#when adding files use: git add (filename)
#when commiting files use: git commit 
#when adding comments/messages: -m "(insert text here)"
#when git push is used, it uploads everything to the internet.
#if the file shows a white circle, that means that it was not saved.
