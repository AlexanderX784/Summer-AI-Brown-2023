libraries can define multiple functions and multiple variables. An example of this is numpy. You are able to import these libraries into your code after installing it in python.
You can call on libraries after installing them. For example, if you improted the math function: 
import math (in order to call the library to your code and allow you to use it)
    from here, you can then use functions from that math function (e.g. math.pow(X,Y)) to find some integer x to the power of y.
    you can also use the square root function in this case, which would be called using math.sqrt(Y)
There are a few ways you can import libraries and their functions into python (libraries are sometimes also called modules):
    1.import (modulename)
    2.import (modulename) as (alternativemodulename)
    2.from (modulename) import (functionname)
    3.from (modulename) import (functionname) as (alternativefunctionname)
